= ConnectorIO + TestContainers

This repository integrates https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java[testcontainers-java] and https://karaf.apache.org[Apache Karaf] docker image.
It is a lightweight (if you take docker out of picture) alternative to traditional pax-exam tests.
Main advantage of testcontainers is possibility to integrate with junit5 ecosystem.
With junit5 and testcontainers all modern testing capabilities can be employed to improve quality assurance of solutions based on Apache Karaf.

== Usage

In order to conduct your tests, use standard testcontainers structure, i.e.:
[source,java]
----
include::karaf/src/test/java/org/connectorio/testcontainers/karaf/KarafContainerTest.java[]
----

Since applications deployed in wild have various behaviors and options karaf test container implementation supports concept of a `Customization`.
The `Customization` can be seen as both - a pax-exam option but also capability (i.e. initialized http client to call deployed REST api).
Above example includes `ShellCustomization` which allows to open a ssh shell session.
It does also include `KarafUserCustomization` which injects an admin user.

You can implement your own `Customization` which reflect specifics of your distribution.
Each `Customization` needs to be registered before container start.
Customization is bound to container lifecycle and can declare dependencies which allows to adjust startup order of all customizations:
